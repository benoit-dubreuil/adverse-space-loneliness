# Adverse Space Loneliness

## The Project

### Goals
- Actually finish the development of a game
- Learn the basics and the framework of LibGDX
- Learn how to make 2D game with LibGDX
- Use the procedural content generator library Noise4J

### Development Steps

#### Assets Subproject
1. Standardized the sprites from the _retro-pixel-space-shooter-shmup-pack_ by mirroring them and renaming them using a _PowerShell_ script
2. Created a _Java_ tool accompanied with a _Gradle_ script to split all sprite strips
3. Created a _Java_ tool accompanied with a _Gradle_ script to pack all sprites into a texture atlas
4. Created a _Java_ tool to generate IDs in a _Java enum_ for all the generated assets

### Tools & Requirements
#### Development
- IntelliJ IDEA Community as the project IDE
- Java JDK 11
- Gradle 5.3 (will be downloaded automatically by the Gradle wrapper)

#### Play
- Java JRE 11

#### Both
- OpenGL version 3.0

### Abandon

I abandoned the project.

The reasons behind this is my lack of free time to continue this project (university & other more interesting projects) and because I lack the resources to make a game that I would be proud of. More precisely, the asset pack that I bought was incomplete and didn't match my vision for the game.

However, I did program **multiple useful tools** for a game engine, such as the **code generation tool** for **generated assets**.
